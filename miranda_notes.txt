Other questions for Pavel:
- ./cassius accept -d (what's going on?)

got some error messages about the correct number of command-line args when I was
trying to run it -- but
'./cassius accept -d FooBar bench/test.rkt test'
 works for whatever reason (??)
 there's nothing related to FooBar in the file directory
--- I think it's just acting as a place-holder?
--The behavior seems to be the same exact as just calling './cassius debug bench/test.rkt test'



* It looks like render is what we want to adjust (I think)




"accept -d" =? debug
! =
sketch =? rsketch =
! =
verify
