Other questions for Pavel:
- ./cassius accept -d (what's going on?)

got some error messages about the correct number of command-line args when I was
trying to run it -- but
'./cassius accept -d FooBar bench/test.rkt test'
 works for whatever reason (??)
 there's nothing related to FooBar in the file directory
--- I think it's just acting as a place-holder?
--The behavior seems to be the same exact as just calling './cassius debug bench/test.rkt test'



* It looks like render is what we want to adjust (I think)


* It looks like  rsketch handles holes, sketch doesn't.
I tested this out by making bench/test_holes.rkt and running rsketch and sketch:

miranda@miranda-rights:~/Documents/507/Project/forked_cassius/Cassius$ ./cassius rsketch bench/test_holes.rkt test
./cassius: 6: [: xrsketch: unexpected operator
;; 1 rules, 3 elements, 4 boxes
[   0.011s] Produced 263 constraints of 10674 terms
[   0.914s] Prepared 944 constraints of 23670 terms

Success.

div {
  height: 2287.5216px;
  padding-top: 8.5216px;
  padding-right: 7.0px;
  border-bottom-width: 68.0px;
  border-top-style: none;
  border-right-style: dotted;
  float: left;
}

I then updated the rsketch file so it would print out the stylesheet like sketch does, and got this output:

./cassius sketch bench/test_holes.rkt test
./cassius: 6: [: xsketch: unexpected operator
;; 1 rules, 3 elements, 4 boxes

}


"accept -d" =? debug
! =
sketch =? rsketch =
! =
