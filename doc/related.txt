I'm a PL student at UW considering a project to automatically generate CSS from examples of HTML documents and renders. The goal would be to automate the photoshop mockup â†’ CSS file pipeline, in particular fiddling with the CSS box model. I know your work isn't exactly in this area, but I was hoping you might be able to give me pointers into the HCI literature.

Do you know if anything related has been done in the HCI community? I'm vaguely aware of programming by demonstration for creating visualizations, and with Thibaud Hottelier's work, but that's about the extent of my knowledge.

Jeffrey Heer:

Not that I know of. Some potentially relevant work that comes to mind is Bricolage (http://hci.stanford.edu/research/bricolage/) and its sister project Webzeitgeist (http://webzeitgeist.stanford.edu/), though they are focused on different problems then what you describe.

There is also our own work on ReVision (http://idl.cs.washington.edu/papers/revision/), which goes from rendered bitmaps to visualization & data models.

James Fogarty:

Off the top of my head, I thought to point you at Hottelier's work.
But you already know that.

I've seen this:

And this, plus the stuff it cites:

http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2642918.2647411

But I don't think I've seen anybody proposing what you're saying.
Doesn't mean it's not out there, just that I haven't seen it. You
might also ask Jeff Heer.


One potential issue in your proposal is the need to maintain two
things (i.e., the documents, the render). If the automation process
leads to me constantly hopping back and forth between these to keep
them in sync for the sake of automation, then you've probably lost. I
don't think this is inherent to your idea, just something to keep an
eye on. In interface toolkits, model-based UIs ran into this problem.
It was more work to create the representation instead of just outright
doing it yourself.
