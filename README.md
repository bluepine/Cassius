Cassius
=======

Cassius synthesizes CSS from examples of how a website should look.
Unlike WYSIWYG tools like Dreamweaver or Photoshop,
  Cassius can generate responsive designs
  that work well even when the content or screen size change.

Current Status
--------------

Cassius implementation has just begun;
  for now, it supports only a part of CSS2.1.
It can already synthesize some simple layouts
  including centering and box layout.

Installing
----------

Cassius requires Racket 6.1 or later and Z3 4.3 or later.
It works best on Linux.

Running Tests
-------------

We donâ€™t have tests yet.
