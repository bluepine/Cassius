  <h2>Abstract</h2>

  <blockquote class="abstract">
    <p>
      Web pages define their appearance using Cascading Style Sheets, a
      modular language for layout of tree-structured documents. In
      principle, using CSS is easy: the developer specifies declarative
      constraints on the layout of an HTML document (such as the
      positioning of nodes in the HTML tree), and the browser solves the
      constraints to produce a box-based rendering of that document. In
      practice, however, the subtleties of CSS semantics make it difficult
      to develop stylesheets that produce the intended layout across
      different user preferences and browser settings.
    </p>
     
    <p>
      This paper presents the first mechanized formalization of a
      substantial fragment of the CSS semantics. This formalization is
      equipped with an efficient reduction to the theory of
      quantifier-free linear real arithmetic, enabling effective automated
      reasoning about CSS stylesheets and their behavior. We implement
      this reduction in Cassius, a solver-aided framework for building
      semantics-aware tools for CSS. To demonstrate the utility of
      Cassius, we prototype new tools for automated verification,
      debugging, and synthesis of CSS code. We show that these tools work
      on fragments of real-world websites, and that Cassius is a practical
      first step toward solver-aided programming for the web.
    </p>

  <h2>Paper</h2>

  <p>
    The paper explains how Cassius works, the main limitations that
    make its efficient translation to SMT possible, and the various
    tools that can be built atop it. It will be posted once final
    revisions are complete.
