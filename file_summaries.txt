debug.rkt

Basically looks like it just calls parse on the input file and sets flags based
on command-line args, then calls (solve ...) (solve is defined in frontend.rkt)
 and prints the result. No real parsing or code generation in this file.

still not really sure what's going on in everything after (module+ main)...
-- probably something to ask Pavel about.

takes document, rendering, style-sheet, and property but I can't tell what
 variables in debug.rkt refer to those command-line arguments.


frontend.rkt

solve definition: takes in 2-4 arguments
      1. just sets up a way to time how long it takes
